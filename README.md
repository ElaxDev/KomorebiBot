<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This is a Discord bot just made for fun and I will be adding to it as many ideas I get so it will have a lot of commands in the future. You can propose features as well as add commands to it yourself.

### Built With

* [NodeJs](https://nodejs.org/es/)
* [Discord.Js](https://discord.js.org/)
* [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/)

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

First we will need to have NodeJs and npm installed, npm is installed automatically when you install NodeJs but you can ensure you have the last version installed running:

```sh
npm install npm@latest -g
```

And you will also need to have mongodb installed, we recommend the version 4.4.1 since is the one this project is using.

### Installation

1. Clone the repo

```sh
git clone https://github.com/ElaxDev/KomorebiBot.git
```

2. Install NPM packages

```sh
npm install
```

3. Create a .env file

```env
NODE_ENV=development
TOKEN=YOUR TOKEN GOES HERE
PREFIX=YOUR BOT PREFIX GOES HERE
MONGO_PATH=mongodb://localhost:27017
```
